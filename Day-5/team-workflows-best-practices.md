## 1. 🚨 Push Rejected — "Unable to Push"

### The Problem
```
! [rejected]        main -> main (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'origin'
```

### Why It Happens
When two developers work on the same branch:
- Developer A pushes a commit
- Developer B (you) tries to push WITHOUT pulling Developer A's latest commit first
- Your local branch is **behind** the remote — Git blocks you to prevent overwriting Developer A's work
- The difference comes from mismatched local vs remote commit IDs

### The Solution: **Always Pull Before You Push**

```bash
# If there is only one remote branch
git pull

# If there are multiple branches
git pull origin <branch-name>

# Then push your changes
git push
```

---

## 2. ⛓️ Pull Strategies — Fast-forward vs Merge vs Rebase

### Strategy 1: Fast-Forward Pull ✅
Works **only** when your local branch has NO new commits since the last pull — there is no commit divergence.

```
Remote: A ── B ── C
Local:  A ── B         (behind by 1)

After git pull (fast-forward):
Local:  A ── B ── C    (pointer just moved forward, no extra commit)
```

```bash
git pull    # fast-forward happens automatically when possible
```

---

### Strategy 2: Pull with Merge (--no-rebase)
When both local and remote have new commits (diverged), Git merges them and creates an **extra merge commit**.

```
Remote: A ── B ── C
Local:  A ── B ── D     (you committed D locally)

After git pull --no-rebase:
Local:  A ── B ── D ── M   (M is the merge commit)
                  \   /
                   C──
```

```bash
git pull --no-rebase
# or just: git pull  (merge is the default when diverged)
```

> ✅ **Safer for teams unfamiliar with rebase.** Full history preserved.  
> ⚠️ Creates an extra merge commit in history which can look cluttered.

---

### Strategy 3: Pull with Rebase (--rebase)
Applies your local commits **on top of** the fetched remote commits. Keeps history linear with no extra merge commit. Your local commits get **new commit hashes** (renamed).

```
Remote: A ── B ── C
Local:  A ── B ── D     (you committed D locally)

After git pull --rebase:
Local:  A ── B ── C ── D'  (D' is your commit replayed on top, new hash)
```

```bash
git pull --rebase
```

> ✅ Cleaner linear history — looks like everyone worked in sequence.  
> ⚠️ **Never rebase commits that have already been pushed to a shared remote branch** — it rewrites history and causes conflicts for teammates.

---

### Pull Strategy Comparison

| Strategy | Command | Creates Merge Commit? | History Style | Best For |
|----------|---------|----------------------|---------------|---------|
| Fast-forward | `git pull` | ❌ No | Linear | When no divergence |
| Merge | `git pull --no-rebase` | ✅ Yes | Branched | Safe team default |
| Rebase | `git pull --rebase` | ❌ No | Linear | Clean history preference |

---

## 3. 🍒 git cherry-pick — Apply Specific Commits

Cherry-pick lets you take **one specific commit** from any branch and apply it to your current branch — without merging the entire branch.

**Common use case:** A bug was fixed on a feature branch. You need that fix on `main` immediately without waiting for the full feature to be ready.

### How to Cherry-Pick

```bash
# Step 1: Find the commit hash you want
git log --oneline feature-branch
# abc1234 Fix critical null pointer bug
# def5678 Add new feature (not ready yet)

# Step 2: Switch to the target branch
git checkout main

# Step 3: Cherry-pick only the bugfix commit
git cherry-pick abc1234

# Step 4: Push
git push
```

### Cherry-Pick a Range of Commits
```bash
git cherry-pick <oldest-hash>^..<newest-hash>
# Example:
git cherry-pick abc123^..def456
```

---

## 4. cherry-pick vs merge — Comparison

| Feature | `git cherry-pick` | `git merge` |
|---------|------------------|------------|
| **Purpose** | Apply specific commit(s) from one branch | Combine **all** changes from one branch |
| **History Impact** | Adds only selected commits | Merges complete branch history |
| **Common Use Case** | Hotfixes, picking specific features/bugfixes | Feature complete — bring all dev work in |
| **Example** | "Just give me that one bugfix" | "Feature is done, merge everything" |

---

## 5. 🔄 git rebase — Linear History

Rebase moves (replays) your commits to start from the tip of another branch, making history look like everyone worked in sequence.

```bash
# You're on feature branch, you want main's latest commits included
git checkout feature
git rebase main

# After rebase, merge back cleanly (will be fast-forward)
git checkout main
git merge feature
```

**Before rebase:**
```
main:    A ── B ── C
feature: A ── B ── D ── E
```

**After `git rebase main` (on feature branch):**
```
main:    A ── B ── C
feature: A ── B ── C ── D' ── E'   (D and E replayed on top of C)
```

---

## 6. 🔧 Interactive Rebase — Edit History

Interactive rebase lets you rewrite, combine, reorder, or delete commits before sharing them. Use it to clean up your commit history before merging.

```bash
# Interactively manage the last 3 commits
git rebase -i HEAD~3

# Interactively manage the last 4 commits
git rebase -i HEAD~4
```

This opens a text editor showing your commits:
```
pick a1b2c3 Add login page
pick d4e5f6 Fix typo in login
pick 7g8h9i Add validation to login
```

### Available Actions

| Action | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| `pick` | Keep the commit as-is |
| `reword` | Keep the commit but change the message |
| `edit` | Pause and make changes to the commit |
| `squash` | Combine this commit INTO the previous one (keeps both messages) |
| `fixup` | Combine into previous commit (discards this message) |
| `drop` | Remove the commit entirely |

### Common Interactive Rebase Tasks

#### Squash multiple commits into one
```
pick  a1b2c3 Add login page
squash d4e5f6 Fix typo in login      ← squash into above
squash 7g8h9i Add validation          ← squash into above
```
Result: One clean commit "Add login page"

#### Reword a commit message
```
reword a1b2c3 Fix typo in login page  ← opens editor to rename
pick   d4e5f6 Add validation
```

#### Drop a commit
```
pick   a1b2c3 Add login page
drop   d4e5f6 Debug code (shouldn't be here)
pick   7g8h9i Add validation
```

> ⚠️ **Never interactive-rebase commits already pushed to a shared remote branch.**

## 7. 🙈 .gitignore — Exclude Files from Tracking

The `.gitignore` file tells Git which files and folders to **never track or stage** — even if they exist in your project folder.

### Create .gitignore
```bash
# Create in the root of your repository
touch .gitignore
```

### Common .gitignore Patterns
```gitignore
# Ignore all .log files anywhere in the project
*.log

# Ignore a specific folder
temp/
node_modules/

# Java — ignore build output
target/

# Python — ignore cache
__pycache__/
*.pyc
venv/

# .NET — ignore build output
bin/
obj/

# Environment files (NEVER commit secrets!)
.env
.env.local

# OS files
.DS_Store        # Mac
Thumbs.db        # Windows

# IDE files
.idea/
.vscode/
*.suo
```

### Key Facts about .gitignore

- Git will **not track** files and folders listed in `.gitignore`
- The `.gitignore` file itself **IS tracked** by Git — commit it!
- Patterns are case-sensitive on Linux/Mac
- Use `*` as wildcard: `*.log` ignores all log files
- Use `/` to target directories: `temp/` ignores the temp folder
- Use `!` to un-ignore: `!important.log` tracks this one log file

## 8. 🍴 Git Fork — Contributing Without Write Access

**Forking** creates your own personal copy of someone else's repository under your GitHub account. You can make any changes to your fork without affecting the original.

### When to Fork
- Contributing to an open-source project you don't own
- Experimenting with changes on a public repo
- Making customizations that are not suitable for the original repo

### Fork Workflow
```
Original Repo (someone else's)
        │
        ▼
   Fork to YOUR GitHub account  ← Click "Fork" button on GitHub
        │
        ▼
   git clone your-fork-url      ← clone YOUR fork locally
        │
        ▼
   git checkout -b my-feature   ← create a branch in your fork
        │
   Make changes → commit → push to your fork
        │
        ▼
   Open a Pull Request          ← propose your changes to the original repo
        │
        ▼
   Original repo owner reviews and merges (or rejects)
```

### Fork vs Clone vs Branch

| | Fork | Clone | Branch |
|-|------|-------|--------|
| **Creates copy where?** | Your GitHub account | Your local machine | Inside same repo |
| **Affects original?** | ❌ Never | ❌ Never | ❌ Not until merged |
| **Write access needed?** | ❌ No | ❌ No (for public) | ✅ Yes |
| **Use case** | Open source contribution | Start working on a repo | Feature development on your own repo |

## 9. 🛡️ Branch Protection Rules

Branch protection rules prevent **unauthorized or accidental changes** to critical branches like `main`, `master`, or `release`. This is configured on GitHub under: `Settings → Branches → Add Rule`.

### Common Protection Rules

| Rule | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Require pull request before merging** | No direct `git push` to this branch allowed — all changes must go via PR |
| **Require approvals** | At least 1 (or more) reviewer must approve the PR before merge |
| **Require status checks to pass** | CI/CD pipeline (tests, linting) must pass before merge allowed |
| **Require linear history** | Only allow rebase merges — no merge commits |
| **Restrict who can push** | Only specific users or teams can merge |
| **Require signed commits** | All commits must be GPG signed for identity verification |

### Why Branch Protection Matters (DevOps context)
- Enforces code review → better code quality
- CI/CD must pass → no broken code reaches main
- Audit trail → every change has a linked PR with discussion
- Prevents accidental `git push --force` overwriting shared history

## 10. Setting Upstream for New Branches

```bash
# Push a new branch for the first time + set upstream tracking
git push -u origin feature-branch

# Alternative way to set upstream
git push --set-upstream origin feature-branch

# After upstream is set, simple commands work:
git push   # pushes to the linked remote branch
git pull   # pulls from the linked remote branch

# Check which remote branch your local branch is tracking
git branch -vv
```

---

## 11. Complete Team Workflow — Putting It All Together

```bash
# 1. Start fresh — pull latest main
git checkout main
git pull

# 2. Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature-user-auth

# 3. Work on your feature — make commits
git add .
git commit -m "Add JWT authentication"
git add .
git commit -m "Add token refresh logic"

# 4. Meanwhile, teammates pushed to main — rebase to stay current
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main

# 5. Push your branch
git push -u origin feature-user-auth

# 6. Open a Pull Request on GitHub for code review

# 7. After approval, merge PR on GitHub

# 8. Clean up locally
git checkout main
git pull
git branch -d feature-user-auth
```
